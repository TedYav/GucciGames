Voogasalad Cloud Utility :)
v0.5

Implemented Features: High Scores
Coming Soon: Game Saves and Game Data

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Pull the voogasalad.util repository.
2. Copy it into your team's voogasalad repository. 
	a. I recommend keeping it in voogasalad.util rather than voogasalad_TeamName.util (or imports will break).
3. Copy the src/lib folder from the utility folder to your own src/lib folder.
4. Import necessary libraries: 
	a. commons-codec-1.10.jar
	b. commons-httpclient-3.1.jar
	c. commons-io-2.4.jar
	d. commons-logging-1.2.jar 
	(Right click on each of them in Eclipse, going down to Build Path, and clicking Add to Build Path.)
5. Edit CloudConfig.properties located in the voogasalad.util.cloud.config package
6. Change GroupName to your group's name, change GroupID to your group's ID -> I've listed ID's for each group.
	a. The utility could automatically register you, but I decided to make it easier :)
7. Look at CloudExample.java for how to use the utility!

ENJOY :) HAPPY THANKSGIVING :)
